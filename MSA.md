# Multiple Sequence Alignment

This page enables visualization of aligned protein sequences for various groups of AKRs that are stored in our database. To use it, select a group of interest from the interactive menu to adjust the set of sequences output. The alignment is created with MSAViewer, which provides an interactive JavaScript-based visualization of multiple sequence alignment. Options for the aligner can be set with the blue buttons, including the color scheme. Further details can be found in the MSAViewer user manual and this GitHub repository on available color schemes.
